## Build the project

### Building with GNOME Builder

The easiest method, just follow [this guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/BuildProject), you'll be up and running in one minute.

### Building from Git

```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/somas/apostrophe/
$ cd apostrophe
$ meson builddir --prefix=/usr -Dprofile=development
$ sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

Then you can run the installed package:

```bash
$ apostrophe
```

Or a local version which runs from the source tree
```bash
$ ./builddir/local-apostrophe
```

To use apostrophe, please make sure you have some dependencies installed:

- `meson` and `ninja-build` are required to build and install Apostrophe
- Pandoc, the program used to convert Markdown to basically anything else (the package name should be `pandoc` in most distributions)
- GTK3 and GLib development packages, along with GObject-introspection
- webkit2gtk is also needed for the preview panel
- GSpell and gettext for l18n and spell checking
- Please find these packages on your distribution/pip: `python3 python3-regex python3-setuptools python3-levenshtein python3-enchant python3-gi python3-cairo python3-pypandoc`
- Optional dependencies are `texlive` and `texlie-latex-extra` for the pdftex module; `libjs-mathjax` for formula preview.


### Building a flatpak package

It's also possible to build, run and debug a flatpak package. You'll need flatpak-builder for this:

```bash
$ cd build-aux/flatpak
$ flatpak-builder --force-clean --install --user _build org.gnome.gitlab.somas.Apostrophe.json
```
